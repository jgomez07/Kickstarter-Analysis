# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns for a Successful Launch 

## Overview of Project

**This analysis focuses on identifying historical campaign data trends.**   

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to perform data analysis on crowdfunding projects and uncover links to trends to launch a successful project campaign.  

## Analysis and Challenges

My client Louise, aims to launch a successful kickstarter campaign. The analysis that I performed here mainly focused on finding trends in goal amount data as well as in launch date data. This information could provide Louise with the information needed to establish a goal amount and launch date. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Data from 2014 to 2017 and taken and the months were analyzed against the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Outcome data including successful, failed, and canceled campaigns was compared against goal ranges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- The dataset provided for this analysis was indeed robust and information dense. The dataset was conducive to rendering information and trends beyond those tell which goal to establish and when to launch the campaign. It is very likely that there would've been challenges faced if the dataset had been scarce of historical information.  

## Results

- By analyzing the historical goal data, I was able to identify that kickstarters have been shown to be more likely to be successful if the goal is less than $1000 or has a maximum goal amount of $4999. Additionally, the data also suggests that a campaign is likely to be successful and meet its goal if it is launched during the month of May and that December is not a good month to launch a campaign as there are very few successful campaigns during that month.   

- Some limitations include the data not being overly specific to the type of play that Louise wants to launch this campaign for. 

- Another possible visualization could be one getting more information from Louise and finding out her ideal play. Then filtering goal and launch date data to render trends specific to Louise's campaign.
